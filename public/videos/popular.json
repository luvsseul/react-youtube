Jesus said this to a crowd of thousands before also saying it to Simon while they stood on water. Season 4? Jesus is weary and heavy-laden, and He needs rest.\n\nWe're getting closer and closer to Jerusalem, to what we know is coming. Jesus is getting increasingly frustrated, and yes, sad. Not because he's getting closer to death, but because of the reasons He must die. From his faith's religious leaders, to the holy city of Jerusalem, to his own friends and followers, people are not understanding his mission. To that end, He must allow painful things, and even set in motion certain confusing or bittersweet events, to accelerate the outcomes that will lead to Holy Week. \n\nSeason 4 marks the midpoint of the most famous and influential story in human history. It will be painful, and it will be joyous. It will be bittersweet. But by all measures, Season 4 will also be our best.\n\n- Dallas Jenkins, Creator of The Chosen",

                "description": "Bobby Carter | December 18, 2023\nScarface's Tiny Desk concert radiates with his decadeslong passion as an emcee and producer. There's calculated intent behind every word and note of this 30-minute set and I learned that his love for golf also runs deep during our initial meeting. He was playing a round and had difficulty dividing his attention between the plan and the course. Three days before the show, amid rehearsals, I got a call from Facemob asking, \"What if I brought Mike Dean?\" My expectations were already high, but that final addition set the stage for something special.\n\nMike Dean provided unmatched authenticity, and their shared stories added sentimental value to this performance. After all, his signature keys and synths can be heard on most of Scarface's classics and countless Rap-A-Lot records. Here, we get a rare glimpse of Scarface the conductor, bouncing through multiple eras of his catalog including \"On My Block,\" \"Mary Jane\" and the bone-chilling \"I Seen a Man Die.\"\n\nScarface, along with Rakim, was recently awarded the inaugural Hip-Hop Grandmaster Award from the newly launched Paid in Full Foundation, which includes a sizable financial prize and healthcare. No matter how the never-ending hip-hop greats debate is sliced, the rapper's place is cemented as one of the most influential storytellers in the culture and his Tiny Desk is proof.\n\nSET LIST\n\"On My Block\"\n\"Mary Jane\"\n\"Smile\"\n\"I Seen a Man Die\"\n\"F**k Faces\"\n\"Mind Playing Tricks on Me\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nScarface: lead vocals, guitar\nMike Dean: keys\nSteven \"Spud\" Howard: vocals\nTakai \"Cookie\" Hicks: vocals \nPeigh Jones: vocals, guitar \nCorey \"FunkaFingers\" Stoot: guitar \nJosh Henderson: keys\nJason \"The Bishop\" Allen: keys\nSavar Martin: drums \nAnthony \"Antboogie\" Nicholson: bass, musical direction \n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Bobby Carter\nDirector: Maia Stern\nEditor: Joshua Bryant\nAudio Engineer: Josh Rogosin\nVideographers: Maia Stern, Joshua Bryant, Alanté Serene, Michael Zamora\nAudio Assistant: Ted Mebane\nProduction Assistant: Ashley Pointer\nPhotographer: Elizabeth Gillis\nTiny Desk Team: Suraya Mohamed, Kara Frame, Hazel Cills\nSeries Creators: Bob Boilen, Stephen Thompson\nVP, Visuals and Music: Keith Jenkins\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann\n\n#nprmusic #tinydesk #scarface",

                    "description": "Bobby Carter | December 18, 2023\nScarface's Tiny Desk concert radiates with his decadeslong passion as an emcee and producer. There's calculated intent behind every word and note of this 30-minute set and I learned that his love for golf also runs deep during our initial meeting. He was playing a round and had difficulty dividing his attention between the plan and the course. Three days before the show, amid rehearsals, I got a call from Facemob asking, \"What if I brought Mike Dean?\" My expectations were already high, but that final addition set the stage for something special.\n\nMike Dean provided unmatched authenticity, and their shared stories added sentimental value to this performance. After all, his signature keys and synths can be heard on most of Scarface's classics and countless Rap-A-Lot records. Here, we get a rare glimpse of Scarface the conductor, bouncing through multiple eras of his catalog including \"On My Block,\" \"Mary Jane\" and the bone-chilling \"I Seen a Man Die.\"\n\nScarface, along with Rakim, was recently awarded the inaugural Hip-Hop Grandmaster Award from the newly launched Paid in Full Foundation, which includes a sizable financial prize and healthcare. No matter how the never-ending hip-hop greats debate is sliced, the rapper's place is cemented as one of the most influential storytellers in the culture and his Tiny Desk is proof.\n\nSET LIST\n\"On My Block\"\n\"Mary Jane\"\n\"Smile\"\n\"I Seen a Man Die\"\n\"F**k Faces\"\n\"Mind Playing Tricks on Me\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nScarface: lead vocals, guitar\nMike Dean: keys\nSteven \"Spud\" Howard: vocals\nTakai \"Cookie\" Hicks: vocals \nPeigh Jones: vocals, guitar \nCorey \"FunkaFingers\" Stoot: guitar \nJosh Henderson: keys\nJason \"The Bishop\" Allen: keys\nSavar Martin: drums \nAnthony \"Antboogie\" Nicholson: bass, musical direction \n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Bobby Carter\nDirector: Maia Stern\nEditor: Joshua Bryant\nAudio Engineer: Josh Rogosin\nVideographers: Maia Stern, Joshua Bryant, Alanté Serene, Michael Zamora\nAudio Assistant: Ted Mebane\nProduction Assistant: Ashley Pointer\nPhotographer: Elizabeth Gillis\nTiny Desk Team: Suraya Mohamed, Kara Frame, Hazel Cills\nSeries Creators: Bob Boilen, Stephen Thompson\nVP, Visuals and Music: Keith Jenkins\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann\n\n#nprmusic #tinydesk #scarface"

Sadot's Super News 🎮💥\"\n\n🌌 Durag Nation, brace yourselves for a major update on the Insomniac Games hack, arguably the worst leak in gaming history. Skip the intros - we're diving straight into this critical situation. If you value this kind of urgent gaming news, smash that like button or hit dislike as you see fit. Let's get into it. 🎮🔔\n\n🔹 'Insomniac Games Under Siege': First, a shoutout to the team at Insomniac, who are facing a tough time with both their hard work being compromised and personal employee information leaked. This isn't just about the games; it's about real people behind them whose lives are at risk. 🚨👥\n\n🔹 'Massive Scale of the Leak': The hackers demanded a ransom and even hosted an auction for the stolen data. After a week, they released most of what they had - over 1 million files, totaling 1.6 terabytes. This includes everything from employee passports to the licensing agreement between Marvel Games and Insomniac. 📛📂\n\n🔹 'Targeted Attack on Insomniac and Sony': The hackers' intention was purely monetary, choosing Insomniac and Sony as they believed gaming companies would be easy targets. They accessed the network in under 30 minutes, and the fallout is catastrophic. 💰🕹️\n\n🔹 'Impact on Insomniac’s Future Plans': Every plan Insomniac had for the next decade is now exposed, including budgets, release years, and identities of upcoming games. 'Marvel’s Wolverine' has been particularly hit hard, with gameplay, cutscenes, and the entire story leaked. 🌐🎮\n\n🔹 'Comparisons to GTA 6 Leak': While GTA 6 suffered a leak of early test footage, the scale of Insomniac's breach is unparalleled. This could potentially lead to a major reshuffle of 'Marvel’s Wolverine', especially its storyline. 🎭🔍\n\n🔹 'Protecting Employees and Bolstering Security': The primary focus now is ensuring the safety of affected employees and significantly upgrading Sony's security to prevent future incidents. This leak will undoubtedly have a lasting impact on the gaming industry. 🔐🛡️\n\nYou would have to mute everything related to Spider-Man, Spider-Man 2, Spider-Man 3, Venom, The X-Men, and Wolverine to avoid spoilers\n\n#wolverineps5 #wolverine #MarvelsWolverine #InsomniacGames #GamingNews #PlayStation5 #SpiderMan2 #marvel",
